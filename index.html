    <h1>NATURAL PRODUCT MINI PROJECT</h1>
    <h2>Merasma Flakes</h2>
    <section class="intro">
        <h3>Project Purpose</h3>
        <p class="caption">
          This Natural Product Mini Project was undertaken by students of the Department of Pharmacognosy and Herbal Medicine,
          School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Cape Coast. The objective was to formulate and analyze a
          natural product (Marasma Flakes) derived from local raw materials using standard pharmacognostic procedures.
        </p>
      
        <h3>Website Purpose</h3>
        <p class="caption">
          This website documents the entire process — from raw material selection through processing, screening, and final packaging.
          It serves as a digital portfolio for the project, promoting transparency, educational value, and accessibility for academic or professional review.
        </p>

    <h3>Step 1: Raw Material Selection</h3>
    <div class="image-group">
        <img src="Merasma/6.jpg" alt="Raw Material 1">
        <img src="Merasma/26.jpg" alt="Raw Material 2">
    </div>
    <p class="caption">The raw materials — Cyperus esculentus (tiger nut), Cocos nucifera (coconut), Zingiber officinale (ginger) and honey
        — were carefully sourced from verified and 
        trusted suppliers to ensure quality, authenticity, and safety for formulation.</p>

    <h3>Step 2: Processing of Raw Materials</h3>
    <div class="image-group">
        <img src="Merasma/1.jpg" alt="Processing 1">
        <img src="Merasma/2.jpg" alt="Processing 2">
    </div>
    <p class="caption"> The purchased raw materials were thoroughly washed with 
        clean water to remove impurities. Ginger, coconut and tigernut were then
        grated using sterile equipment to obtain desirable size and shape, 
        increase surface area and aid drying.</p>

    <h3>Step 3: Drying of Raw Materials</h3>

        <img src="Merasma/17.jpg" alt="Final Product">
    </div>
    <p class="caption">
        The grated materials were oven-dried at a controlled temperature of 75°C for a 
        period of 24 hours. 
        This ensured consistent moisture reduction while preserving key phytochemical constituents.
    </p>
    <h4> Step 4: Phytochemical Screening</h4>
    <div class="image-group">
        <img src="Merasma/14.jpg" alt="Final Product">
        <img src="Merasma/3.jpg" alt="Final Product">
        <img src="Merasma/15.jpg" alt="Final Product">
        <img src="Merasma/16.jpg" alt="Final Product">
        <img src="Merasma/11.jpg" alt="Final Product">
        <img src="Merasma/12.jpg" alt="Final Product">
        <img src="Merasma/8.jpg" alt="Final Product">
    </div>
    <p class="caption">
        After drying, a portion of the samples were blended into fine powder. 
        Ethanol and water were used as solvents to extract the phytoconstituents, 
        which were then subjected to phytochemical screening to identify the
        presence of compounds such as flavonoids, alkaloids, tannins, and saponins.
    </p>
    <h5> Step 5: Analytical Screening</h5>
    <div class="image-group">
        <img src="Merasma/4.jpg" alt="Final Product">
        <img src="Merasma/18.jpg" alt="Final Product">
    </div>
    <p class="caption">
        Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC) was carried out on the ginger extract to verify and 
        confirm the specific phytochemical constituents and to assess the quality of the material
    </p>
    <h6> Step 6: Glazing and Drying with Honey</h6>
    <div class="image-group">
        <img src="Merasma/5.jpg" alt="Final Product">
    </div>
    <p class="caption">
        The dried and powdered raw materials were weighed and mixed in a ratio 
        of 3:2:1 for tiger nut, coconut, and ginger respectively. 
        The resulting mixture was then glazed with natural honey to enhance flavor, 
        texture, and shelf-life. 
    </p>
    <h3> Step 7: Weighing and Packaging of Finished Product</h3>
    <div class="image-group">
        <img src="Merasma/28.jpg" alt="Final Product">
        <img src="Merasma/30.jpg" alt="Final Product">
    </div>
    <p class="caption">The finished Marasma Flakes were weighed into appropriate portions and sealed in 
    airtight containers to maintain freshness, stability, and hygiene 
    until use or distribution.</p>
